# Todo-List

Project from the curriculum of TheOdinProject. 

## [Live Demo](https://vladius9512.github.io/Todo-List/)

What did I learn from this project?

* first project where I used localStorage
* made the mistake of not splitting the files from the beginning so I end up having only one javascript file, which in the end turned out to be harder to split into smaller pieces. 
* my logic made me first create the visual of the website and after that create the object and manipulate the data. Turned out to be a mistake that only made me work more. 
* got to exercise more with Objects and I feel like I improved my way to create functions for code that repeats itself
