# Todo-List

Project from the curriculum of TheOdinProject. 

What i learned from this project?

-first project where i used localStorage
-made the mistake of not spliting the files from the beggining so i endep up having only one javascript file, which in the end turnes out to be harder to split into smaller pieaces. 
-my logic made me first create the visual of the website and after that create the object and manipulate the data. Turned out to be a mistake that only made me work more. 
-got to exercise more with Objects and i feel like i improved my way to create functions for code that repeats itself
